Chrome extension to avoid undesired pausing when a gaze tracker sends a click event to the video element.

# Installation

1. Download the extension: https://github.com/spenthil/IgnoreVideoClicks/archive/master.zip
    a. Unzip the downloaded extension. It will create a folder.
2. In your Chrome web browser, Type in chrome://extensions/ in the URL bar and press return.
    a. Click on the Developer mode toggle in the top right corner.
    b. Click on the Load unpacked button.
    c. Navigate to and open the folder you unzipped the extension to in step 1a.
    d. Click Select folder after you have opened the folder.
3. Done! There should be an icon of a monkey covering its eyes next to your URL bar.

# Usage

Load up youtube and use as usual. Clicking on the video itself with mouse/eye gaze tracker shouldn’t pause/play. If it still pauses/plays, try navigating away from the video (clicking on the “YouTube” icon) and go back again.
